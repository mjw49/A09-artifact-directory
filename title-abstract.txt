Title:
Efficiently Clustering Dense Network Graphs by Sampling and Counting Organized Substructures

Abstract:
Network graphs have emerged to be a relevant tool in organizing and investigating the relationship among individual agents in systems within numerous domains of study. Yet in certain contexts, clustering a network
to identify unique sub-populations can uncover hidden insights of the data to encourage further analysis. Although clustering isn’t a relatively novel concept in network science, partitioning around recurring
substructures, or motifs, that cumulatively construct these dense graphs remains unexplored. In order to
perform such clustering, our main endeavor is to develop an efficient pipeline for counting the number of
occurrences of specific substructures in any densely concentrated network graph. Primarily we will be examining the frequency of triangular motifs, all of which contain three separate nodes, but vary in the number
and direction of edges. While required for spectral clustering, motif counting imposes a bottleneck as the
most time-consuming step which we aim to accelerate by introducing sampling algorithms to reduce a dense
network to a sparser, but still representative subset.
